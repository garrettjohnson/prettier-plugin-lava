It takes a collection and a pageSize
{% paginate collection by pageSize %}{% endpaginate %}

It breaks on by pageSize when printWidth is hit
printWidth: 1
{% paginate collection
  by pageSize
%}
  {{ collection }}
{% endpaginate %}

It is undocumented, but it also accepts named attributes (window_size). Those are comma separated.
printWidth: 80
{% paginate collection by pageSize, window_size:50, attr:(0..2) %}
  {{ collection }}
{% endpaginate %}

It is undocumented, but it also accepts named attributes (window_size). We print
those comma separated and on a new line when it breaks.
printWidth: 1
{% paginate collection
  by pageSize,
  window_size:50
%}
  {{ collection }}
{% endpaginate %}
