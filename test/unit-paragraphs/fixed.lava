it should maintain whitespace (or lack of thereof) in flow text.
<div>hello {{ name }}!</div>

it should break child html elements lava prettier would for html
<span>
  Some&nbsp;<b>freeform</b>&nbsp;text
  <em
    >hello world that might span multiple lines. That's fine. It's a paragraph
    after all...</em
  >
  We can definitely deal with that.
</span>

it should break lava tags on new lines when it has leading and trailing
whitespace because it prefers newlines
<div>
  More freeform text
  {%- if lava -%}But with lava instead.{%- endif -%}
  I wonder what this will look like {{ punctuation }}.
</div>

it should break child lava tags on new lines
<div>
  If a child breaks, it breaks on a new line.
  {%- if lava -%}
    <span>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</span>
  {%- endif -%}
  But the paragraph that <i>follows</i> keeps on going as before. If an
  <em>fits on the line line</em>, it flows inline. But it will
  <em>never open in the middle of a line and end on another</em>
</div>

it should maintain whitespace between inline elements
<h1>HELLO <span> WORLD </span></h1>

it should not maintain whitespace between inline elements with htmlWhitespaceSensitivity set to ignore
htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: "ignore"
<h1>
  HELLO
  <span>WORLD</span>
</h1>

if there arent whitespace on either side of the text, when it breaks it should
break on both sides
<p>
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (-
  {{- product.price -}}
  -)
</p>

it should behave like prettier/language-html
<p>
  Ipsum. Praesent scelerisque tortor a justo. Quisque consequat libero erat<em
    >product.price</em
  >ok
</p>

it should break parent and add WTC when the child breaks
<p>
  (-
  {%- if lava -%}
    <span>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</span>
  {%- endif -%}
  -)
</p>

it should add wtc between lava drop and span if the ifbreak breaks.
printWidth: 20
<p>
  {{ drop -}}
  <span
    >Lorem Ipsum</span
  >
</p>
